Purpose of the Program

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To simulate a public transport system in a console-based Java application which allows a user to add as many journeys by prompting the user to enter the date, starting zone, passenger type and if the trip was peak or off peak. After it calculates the zones crossed and correct fare. It also allows the user to remove a journey if a mistake is made or reset whole day after confirmation. Lastly, it helps the rider keep track of fares, monitor expenses and understand how caps and discounts affect the total cost of their journeys.

Diary Entries

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
22/01/2026 Ð Diary Entry 1: Understanding the CityRide Lite Requirements & Initial Planning
Today I focused on understanding the CityRide Lite project requirements in detail. I carefully read through the assessment brief and requirements so i can gain a clear picture of what the program is expected to do. I broke down what is needed into user input, journey storage, fare calculation, discounts, daily caps, summaries, and error handling. I did this to make sure I fully understood system.
After going through the requirements, I found the main components of the program, including adding journeys, listing and filtering journeys, calculating fares using the provided details, and producing daily summaries and totals by passenger type. This helped me understand how the program would operate.
One difficulty I encountered was the large number of functional requirements and deciding which ones represented core user-facing features and internal calculations. I solved this by focusing on what the user selects from the menu as the main features, and treating zone calculations and fare lookups as background processing within those actions. This made things clearer and helped prepare for the IPO tables and Gantt chart.

23/01/2026 Ð Diary Entry 2: Planning the Gantt Chart and Structuring the Analysis
Today I worked on planning the project timeline and creating the Gantt chart. I listed all the major activities required to complete the CityRide Lite project which I organised across weekly time periods to show a logical progression from understanding the problem to final submission.
I structured the timeline so that the early stages focused on analysis, IPO tables, and system design, before moving on to implementation and testing in later weeks. I did this because a clear design is essential before starting to code, especially for a program with complex rules such as fare calculations, discounts, and daily caps.
A challenge I faced was deciding how detailed the Gantt chart tasks should be. Initially, some tasks were too broad, such as ÒDesign program,Ó which did not clearly show progress. I improved this by breaking tasks into more specific activities, such as ÒDesign journey data structure,Ó ÒPlan fare calculation logic,Ó and ÒDesign menu flow.Ó This made the Gantt chart more realistic and easier to understand.


24/01/2026 Ð Diary Entry 3: Finalising IPO Tables and Reviewing the Plan
Today I focused on finalising the analysis documentation, particularly the IPO tables and overall project plan. I created IPO tables for the main CityRide Lite features, including adding journeys, listing and filtering journeys, viewing daily summaries, viewing totals by passenger type, removing journeys, and resetting the day. This helped show how inputs, processes, and outputs flow through the system.
I checked the functional requirements to ensure that each required feature was represented.
One issue I noticed was that some features were doing the same functions, which initially made the analysis feel repetitive. To fix this, I changed the wording of the IPO tables to differentiate between user actions and internal processing. By the end of it, I had a clear, complete analysis and planning document that shows the CityRide Lite requirements and provides a strong foundation for the implementation phase.
